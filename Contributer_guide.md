We expect you to get motivated by the projects and to get involved in how to make them better! 

You will have to work around 4hs per day (small projects) to 6hs per day (large project), during 12 weeks (22 weeks max if we agree). 

We can agree in your time off, and holidays and how to better work with us. 

To get approved in your work during the summer you will be required to present a report 
and Google will ask us an evaluation of your work. This will happen twice during the summer.
