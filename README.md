# Google Summer of Code 2023
Repository with data and documents for Google Summer of Code 2023 proposal for the Stratosphere Laboratory

# About the Stratosphere Laboratory
Our group conducts research at the intersection of machine learning, cybersecurity and helping others. We are part of the Artificial Intelligence Center, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague.

--What is the GSoC and links--

-- About that you should get in contact in Discord and discuss new possible ideas. The ideas we put here are an indication only --

# Stratosphere Linux IPS

### Description of Slips
Slips is a behavioral intrusion prevention system that uses machine learning to detect malicious behaviors in network traffic. Slips focus on targeted attacks, detection of command and control channels, and providing a good visualization for the analyst. It can analyze network traffic in real-time, network captures such as pcap files, and network flows produced by Suricata, Zeek/Bro, and Argus. Slips processes the input data, analyzes it, and highlights suspicious behavior that needs the analyst's attention.

## Communication
The following Mmethods will be used for all projects:

Talk about communication mediums: discord? slack etc? how often are meetings? video calls or coice calls?

Reports: how often? reports about blockers/progress etc

Communications will be done over discord/slack, weekly/daily reports are going to be required,
